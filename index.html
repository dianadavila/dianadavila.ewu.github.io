 <p>Diana is a junior at Eastern Washington University earning two degrees, one in Visual Communication Design and another in Spanish. Creativity has always been in her blood, she’s always been eager to learn and appreciate different forms of art. She’s a firm believer in the magic being in the details to produce the best product possible. In her spare time, she enjoys taking pictures of friends, catching up on sleep and making your coffee as a local barista. 

“Computers are cool, but getting my hands dirty has always been a bit more rewarding.”</p>
